# Student Performance Prediction 🎓

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning model to predict student pass/fail status based on their English 🇬🇧 and Science 🔬 scores.

## Overview

The `NP-SK-PD.py` script creates a synthetic dataset 🧪 of student scores, trains a Logistic Regression model 📊, and evaluates its performance. The goal is to predict if a student `Passed` 🎉 (based on a threshold of 75 in Math ➕, which is derived from English and Science scores with some noise).

## Features ✨

* **Data Generation:** Generates synthetic student data 📈 including Math, English, and Science scores.
* **Logistic Regression:** Uses `scikit-learn`'s Logistic Regression for binary classification. ✅
* **Model Evaluation:** Provides accuracy and a detailed classification report. 🎯
* **Train-Test Split:** Splits data for robust model evaluation. ✂️
